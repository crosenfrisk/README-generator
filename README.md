  ## Installation
  The user will need Node.js on their computer to run; if they do not have that installed they should visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) to download.

  To run the application, the user must also clone the repository from GitHub on to their local device and open in something like Visual Studio Code. 

  ![cloneRepo](/Develop/assets/images/screenshots/cloneRepo.jpg)
  
  From there, running the terminal, users must run `npm install` to get all the correct packages installed on their computer.

  ## Usage
  To use the application, open the cloned repository in Visual Studio Code (or any code editor).
  
  Once inside the root directory of the source code, run the terminal using $Git Bash (or whatever you prefer) to type `node index.js` to start the application.

  Complete the answers to the prompts and the README.md file will be dynamically generated for you.

  Be sure to select the appropriate license for your project; the default license is set to MIT. 
  
  *If you would like to add additional licenses to your README-generator, you may add them to the `generateMarkdown.js` file, following the format used for the existing licenses. Be sure to add any additional licenses inside `index.js` to the questions function, under the object: `type: list` and `choices:`, otherwise the application won't work!*
  
  The finished product will contain a title, description of the project, a table of contents with hyperlinks in markdown to the following sections: instructions for installation, usage, license, contributions, optional tests, and contact instructions for questions.

  You may access the generated `README.md` file from within the `dist` folder.

  To further enhance your README file, you may add photos or additional sections, such **Credits** or **Technologies Used**, depending on the project. The current template includes a placeholder for ## Preview, which is not required but a nice feature to display a screenshot of your deployed project.

  ## Credits ðŸŽ‰

  * Original source code was cloned from [potential-enigma](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/potential-enigma) and modified for personal use.

  ## Test
  To test, you must have the the project downloaded locally, and run from the root directory. After typing `node index.js` in the terminal from within the root directory, answering the prompts should return the generated README.md file located in the dist folder of the project. Errors should return err in the terminal console.
